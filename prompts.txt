1. Use mandrill-vector.svg as my logo. 
2. Redesign the hero section on the landing page to use the mandrill-face-left.jpg image and ensure that the layout looks like the joker-hero-section. Keep the header and everything else on the landing page as they are - just redesin the hero section. Ensure that the image boundaries of the mandrill-face-left.jpg image are not visible - let the image flow into the background smoothly.
3. Redesign the hero section of the business page to use the High-Tech-Workstation.jpg image as the background, and let the text description be at the center of the image. Ensure that viewers can contrast the text from the baskground image, so use a mild, subtle blur effect on the image to achieve this.

I have attached the joker-hero-section for reference and downloaded the required images in the public folder.

Ensure that the above modifications do not break the existing functionality of the website and let them be fully responsive, intearractive and beautiful. Do not overimplement linear gradients to text and buttons, be subtle.

NOTE:
    DO NOT BREAK THE ALREADY WORKING TAILWIND CONFIGURATION.
