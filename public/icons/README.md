# Icons Directory

This directory should contain SVG icons for the website, including:

- Social media icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram, Upwork, WhatsApp)
- Skill icons (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, etc.)
- Service icons (Web Development, Mobile Development, Desktop Development, etc.)

You'll need to add these SVG files to use the website as designed.
